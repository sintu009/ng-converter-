 Using style
Security Risk: Hard-coding styles in the HTML (using the style attribute) doesnâ€™t inherently introduce security issues. However, if you are generating inline styles dynamically from user input or external sources, it could potentially introduce risks if the input is not properly sanitized. For instance, if user input is directly inserted into the style attribute, it might lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if malicious code is injected.
Using ng-style
Security Risk: ng-style can be more flexible but also introduces potential risks if it involves user-generated or external data. If the styles are dynamically generated based on untrusted sources, you should ensure that data is properly sanitized and validated to prevent XSS or other injection attacks.
